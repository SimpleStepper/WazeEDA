# Waze Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Overview 
This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 
* Who are the users most likely to churn?
* Why do users churn? 
* When do users churn? 

This is the continuation of a ongoing project in Googles Advanced Data Analytics Course focusing on the exploratory data analysis of the Waze dataset. The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset. The goal is to continue the examination of the data that you began in the previous Course, adding relevant visualizations that help communicate the story that the data tells.
## Current Project Overview 
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Building Visualizations
4. Evaluating and sharing results

Please reference the Python notebook for more detailed analysis, however key insights are shared below. 
## Quick Insights over project
1. Was there anything that led you to believe the data was erroneous or problematic in any way?
Most of the data was validated through the EDA process. However, many variables had very improbable outlier values, such as driven_km_drives, which had a max of 15,420 KM which is impossible to drive in a day.

2. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?

3. What percentage of users churned and what percentage were retained?
4. What factors correlated with user churn? How?
5. Did newer uses have greater representation in this dataset than users with longer tenure? How do you know?
