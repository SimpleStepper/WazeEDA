# Waze Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Overview 
This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 
*Who are the users most likely to churn?
*Why do users churn? 
*When do users churn? 

This is the continuation of a ongoing project in Googles Advanced Data Analytics Course focusing on the exploratory data analysis of the Waze dataset. The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset. The goal is to continue the examination of the data that you began in the previous Course, adding relevant visualizations that help communicate the story that the data tells.
